- Summary
Movement of stock prices is in response to news or events. With growing of
computational power and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, it enables
more accurate models to predict stock market by mining news. The author has
discovered that extracting text into structured event representation can better capture
actor and event object. Ding et al., in 2014, have shown improvement on model by
using structured representation instead of words as features. However, structured
representation leads to increased sparsity. To handle this problem, the author trained
an embedded network and mapped the representation into dense vector.
Combing news into sequence of dense vectors, the author proposed a
convolutional network to capture both short-term and long-term influence of events
on stock market. And the model is shown to defeat other two financial-news-based
stock market prediction systems proposed in other studies in S&P 500 Index prediction
and individual stock prediction.
